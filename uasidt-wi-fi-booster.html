That’ll help boost your Wi-Fi to stream to your heart’s desire. The RE305 is probably best described as “cute”; it is white with rounded edges and two short antennas. It has three LED lights on the front that indicate whether it’s properly connected, which make its setup a cinch. If you have any doubt, rest easy knowing The store I work P/T doesn't have wi-fi, but next door does and the signal is weak. If I buy one of those plug in boosters would that work? The Wi-Fi has no PW so I assume I would plug it in and it would detect the router. Recently bought one for upstairs. It’s really close to the room I’m in, yet the signal varies greatly; between dropping out entirely, having one bar, two or all three. Mostly it’s on two bars, which is better than connecting to the router downstairs but surely there should be the full three bars considering it’s so close. Any ideas on why I’m not getting maximum signal? Thanks. How do I get a strong Wi-Fi signal from the front house 5 meters. Is this at all possible. I'm having lack of Wi-Fi coverage, and am looking for a solution to properly cover the place, but will be requiring a minimum of 3 access points, most probably. Telenet offers the AP7465CE-TN (https://www2.telenet.be/nl/klantenservice/wat-zijn-de-specificaties-van-de-telenet-powerline-adapters/) (from CBN if I'm not mistaken). Apparently these are plug-and-play systems, which makes messing up the network very difficult, but also, I guess, configuring them. I need to forward a few ports. Hi! First of all sorry for my ignorance, maybe what I am going to ask is so stupid you are all going to facepalm. Basically I discovered my roomate has a wifi booster/repeater connected to the house router (which is in his room). He never gave us the password for it but is connected trough ethernet and serves as router itself. Since then I have noticed the wi-fi is really slow in my room (which comes directly from the home router), I can’t game like before and downloading takes a lot longer. Is £40 a realistic budget? I have Sky broadband with the Sky wi-fi hub running 19 Mbps apparently. I have approx 6 devices connected with one streaming constantly - ipad or tv and the rest phones with push notifications such as emails or news alerts etc. I do occasionally game online via ethernet and my NAT type is usually open, so i think it is a signal strength issue. Thanks in advance. 
So essentially there's a wide consensus that gaming over Wi-Fi isn't advisable. I was wondering how many people use Wi-Fi boosters to connect an ethernet cable to their console. I don't think range for connection is an issue for me, just the location of the router and distance from consoles makes it awkward and difficult to run an Ethernet cable to them as both consoles are in opposite directions of the main router. Plus, don't really want someone tripping over them. Thanks I live in South Africa and for three months my internet has been shoddy with drops and delays. My internet service provider contacted me today and said I should buy an internet Wi-Fi booster to improve my connection. I use a direct cable to the hub, so don't see the need for it. Are they perhaps screwing up my internet to get me to get me to buy their product. I have a Dell XPS tower that I've bought not long ago. I live in the top floor of a 4-storeys share house, the router is located at 1st floor and the signal in my room is quite weak. Especially when using Chromecast, it will lose signal very often. Then my housemate gave me a WiFi booster to plug in to a power outlet in my room, the signal instantly became very strong. But the strange thing happened, my PC just went blank although the power indicator still has light. I tried several power outlet. The Best Wireless Range Extenders for 2019.
